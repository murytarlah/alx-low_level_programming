# C - Functions, nested loops

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at [**Alx School**](https://www.alxafrica.com/). It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.

## Technologies

-   C files are compiled using `gcc 12.0`
-   C files are written according to the C90 standard
-   Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename                                         | Description                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| [0-putchar.c](0-putchar.c)                       | Prints \_putchar to the stdout            |
| [1-alphabet.c](1-alphabet.c)                     | Prints the alphabet in lowercase          |
| [2-print_alphabet_x10.c](2-print_alphabet_x10.c) | Prints 10 times the alphabet in lowercase |
| [3-islower.c](3-islower.c)                       | Checks for lowercase character            |
| [4-isalpha.c](4-isalpha.c)                       | Checks for alphabetic character           |
| [5-sign.c](5-sign.c)                             | Prints the sign of a number               |
| [6-abs.c](6-abs.c)                               | Computes the absolute value of an integer |
